      <h1>The Bard on Fire - Review</h1>
      <p>The story of The Bard on Fire goes like this:
There was once a man whose flesh was so flammable, the first time the sun hit him, we went up in flames, but somehow he wouldn't die from it. Throughout his childhood doctors, pastors and sorcerers tried countless times to extinguish his flames, but to no avail.
Because he was always on fire, nobody dared to touch him and care for him on top of the constant pain he was in.
Despite this, he decided to become a bard, to bring joy into others' life.
He sang of the things he found beautiful in life, such as the sound of a waterfall, the soothing coolness of rain, etc. Some of his songs however, were about the pain he was going through and how it will never go away. However people didn't like these songs. They didn't want to be reminded of the pain, but rather the small joys he could still find in life. As he grew older, the pain of the flames got stronger and stronger, but he continued to sing odes of joy.
Eventually though, he collapsed and died. The flames dying with him, thus concluding the story.

Now that we're clear on the plot, let's talk about the meaning behind the work.
A popular theory is Mallory Quinn's disability theory. To quote from her 2006 book titled 'Symbolism in Famous Stories': "To me, the way people ignored the bard's cries for help resembles how people with disabilities are ignored, misunderstood and often undiagnosed leaving them unmedicated." While this is a widely accepted theory, I think this wasn't the writer's intended message.
What I see in the story is a nihilist trying to create art resembling the entirety of their world, but the ugly truth being shut down in favour of distraction from it.
People were aware of the pain he was going through, but chose to live in blissful ignorance. His songs about his pain forced the listeners to face the truth and realise that, while happy moments exist, his life is mostly consumed by pain.
The fact that not only was there no happy ending where his flames were extinguished, but his pain only worsened as he aged shows how no matter how much you try to be ignorant, the pain will only grow until you can't ignore it anymore.

My conclusion is the following:
Instead of ignoring your problems, face them and do anything you can and more to fix them. Ignorance is, and always will be, nothing but a facade that does nothing but hide the problem as it gets worse and worse.</p>
