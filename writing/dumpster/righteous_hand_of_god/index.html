      <h1>Righteous Hand Of God</h1>
      <p>Today, Mike's diner is just as busy as always. A handful of people drinking, reading newspapers. Not unusual at this time of day. Mary is in the back, cleaning dishes and Mike is tending the bar. However, his eyes get caught on an unusually large shadow.
The thing casting it, is an about 220 cm tall figure, his body covered in bandages head-to-toe. He's wearing a kind of coat you'd usually see on rangers, but clearly, it's not in his size. The only other piece of clothing he has is a cowboy hat; or is it a fedora? It's hard to tell.
- No! - Mike shouts at him - You're not welcome in my diner, Gab! Not after the ruckus you caused last time!
- Come on, Mike - The giant speaks - I was simply doing my job, you can't ban me for that.
- Well, you gotta do your job elsewhere then. I said what I said. Now leave!
The monstrous creature leans on a cabin above Mike before getting real close to his face, leaning down to his level.
- Mike. Mikey. Stop fooling around. I'm simply doing God's work. What you're proposing, that you would set back an agent of God in his work... It very much feels like blasphemy, Mikey. Blasphemy is one of the worst sins you can commit, you know. It would surely launch you near the top of my list. But I know it was nothing but a bad joke, you don't have to explain it.
Mike is slightly sweating at this point and is only grunting under his nose.
- Now get me a glass of red wine, please. Oh, and you should work on your sense of humor. Your jokes are terrible.
As he's turning away from the bar, he sees a biker looking man with a mohawk staring at him. If you could kill with a look, this giant creature would be nothing more than a pool of blood by now.
- Hey big guy! - He says - Your hearing must be faulty, 'cause you're still here even tho' Mike just said you're not welcome.
- Don't worry, it was just one of his horrible jokes. He didn't mean it.
- I'm not so sure about that.
The creature pauses for a second before leaning forward, closer to the man.
- And who did you say you were?
- The guy who's gonna kick your ass if you don't leave right now!
- No like, what was your name?
- What does that matter to you? Leave!
- I'm not leaving until you tell me.
- We'll see about that! - He raises his fists.
The creature sighs before standing up, towering over the man. The man swings his fist toward him, but he sidesteps, and with a swift move snitches his wallet.
- What the- Now you're stealing too?
- God, no! You'll get it it back in a second.
As he's saying this, he's opening up the wallet and looking at the ID inside.
- Matt Hunter, huh... That rings a bell.
- Oh, I wouldn't forget you in a thousand years, trust me, we haven't met. - the man says as he's swinging another punch.
The creature sidesteps again after tossing the wallet so it hits the man's head. By the time he looks at the creature, he pulled out a leather-bound notebook of some sorts, with a cross on the front.
- Matt Hunter... Matt Hunter... Matt- Ah! I knew I heard that name before... - a moment of silence that feels like forever - You're on the list.
As he says that he shuts the book with one hand before throwing it at the man with full power. As the man is falling backwards from the hit, the creature puts his leg behind the man's, to make him fall. As the man is falling the creatures follows, elbow first. Before the man could react, the creature was hitting him in the face with such power that it's a miracle the floor didn't crack. Then again. And again. And again, and again and again and again and again, until what was left of him could not be called a man anymore, only a crime scene. Finally he gets up, opens his notebook and crosses out his name. He then sits back, right where he got up from while Mike looks at him, absolutely terrified.
- So, where's my wine, Mike?</p>
