      <h1>Paperview</h1>
      <p>There's this series I'm watching. It's from the perspective of this guy just going through his life. What's unique about it, is that the whole thing is drawn on cardboard with a graphite pencil. It gives it this unreal feeling.
Sure it might get boring at times. Like when the guy is just walking from one place to another, but at those times I usually think about the things that happened so far, and how the series may continue.
All day, every day, I'm sitting in front of the TV watching this series. Most of the times it's fine, I like just watching things unfold, but sometimes I wanna interact with that world; tell this guy "do this" and "do that." But no matter how loud I scream at my screen, nothing happens. The guy is like a robot, doing the exact same thing over and over again, every day. It's quite boring nowadays.
I remember a time when that wasn't the case though. It sounds dumb now, but back then I could swear it was like whatever I wanted to happen, just happened and actually interesting things happened. But I guess I gotta work with what I have.
Well, I should probably get back to it. I want to say an interesting part is coming up, but that's simply not true.
Take care now!</p>
