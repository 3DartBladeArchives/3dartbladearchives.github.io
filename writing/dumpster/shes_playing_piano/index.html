      <h1>She's Playing Piano</h1>
      <p>When you woke up you found yourself in a mansion so large you couldn't see the ceiling or the walls.

Then you noticed. Someone is playing the piano. Playing a song that causes you to tear up, as if it contained every emotion you ever felt, understood you perfectly and you understood it perfectly.

When you entered the room where the song was coming from, you saw a single beam of light hitting a large piano and the fallen angel who was playing it. The angel had a missing wing and wore grey, torn clothes.

You sat besides her and listened to her playing the piano, putting every emotion she had into the notes she played. She wasn't playing for you, but she knew you were listening to it patiently and felt relieved that someone else heard her play.

While she was playing, time seemed to freeze and thoughts seemed to quiet down. The only thing left were emotions.
Her emotions.
Your emotions.

And you listened for eternity.</p>
