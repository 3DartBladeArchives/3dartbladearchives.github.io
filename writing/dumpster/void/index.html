      <p>I'm starting to think that it's not that bad here after all. I feel really bad while I'm here, but that's kind of all I've ever known. I heard stories about the outside, how it feels good. Stories about the sunshine in your hair, the beautiful songs the birds sing, the smell of fresh air. I tried sitting next to the lamp, while listening to recordings of birds, but the air smells stale so I'm guessing it's not the same. For years I've tried to find the exit, roaming about but the only exits were locked up and barricaded. I'm sure there is an exit somewhere that I can use, but I've been searching for years with no luck. I'm getting really tired. So lately I've just been sitting here, listening to tales from the outside. I've heard so many tales that I can almost see the outside when I close my eyes. Almost. Maybe I shouldn't listen to those stories, they just make me feel bad for not finding an exit.
I feel horrible. It's horrible. I can't bear it anymore. The nothingness is too much, I feel drowned by my own thoughts, I wish they just went quiet, I want them to go quiet I want it to end I want everything to end. Why doesn't it just end...
It doesn't end. It never does.
I tried to starve myself to death before. But the hunger has always overcame me. My body won't let me...
I don't have an appetite anymore. I eat only when I'm starving and even then I feel like throwing up. I don't have the strength to do anything. I'm just lying on the ground unable to move for days. I don't have the strength to stand up, let alone try to tear down the barricades. When I'm lying on the ground, at least I can rest.
Maybe it's not that bad here, lying on the ground. Aside from the thoughts. Even though my thoughts are drowning me, at least I'm not failing at trying. That's better right? It is so much harder to get up and try to get out and I know that I'm just gonna fail. I've been failing since forever, what would make my next attempt any different? There's no point in trying. I'll just live alone, in pain, unable to starve until the end of times. It could be worse. Could it? Maybe not. I'm hopeless.
I could continue writing down my thoughts but they just repeat from here. I don't want to torture you with that. It's enough for me to go through that. Just know that it doesn't end here. Not for me. If I have anything else to write down, I'll continue. Until then, have a great day.</p>
