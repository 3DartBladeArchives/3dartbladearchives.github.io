      <h1>Chapter 7: Eternity</h1>
      <p>TI lay on top of a hill, with slightly dry, yellowish, but still alive grass below me. I'm looking at the mostly blue sky, gazing at the clouds like I always do when I'm thinking about something. Right now, I'm thinking about a man I've seen in a dream not too long ago. At first, I didn't think anything of him, but last night, I had another dream that he was in. However, this older dream was completely different from what I dreamt last night, it's not a recurring dream, just a recurring character.

In that dream, it was beautiful day with blue skies and some clouds just like this one. There was a pub or inn in the middle of a big plain and that man was inside the pub. The man was playing cards. This man, he had short brown hair and some speckles on his face. He wore a blue shirt with a dark brown vest on it, and some weird goggles. He was smiling, because he just won another man's money. The other man was furious, calling him a cheater, threatening to kill him. By the way he said the words, barely understandably, you could tell he was drunk. Others in the bar held him so he wouldn't follow through with his promise telling him that he was dumb to play against him anyways, because he always wins, but he managed to break free and grab him by his neck. He pressed him against the wall. You see, this man who won, he wasn't strong. He was about half the size of any decent man in every way, so he couldn't fight this man back. Just as his eyes started rolling up, and he was losing consciousness and as the man he defeated shouted some unintelligible sentences, someone kicked him in the groin from behind. He released the man, and after a few moments of pain, the man gathered himself and turned around to face the culprit. It's a red, curly haired woman with a simple, plain green outfit, a skin as white as snow, a few freckles and a deadly gaze.
- You' gon' pay f'r this! - He mumbled, barely understandably.
He rushed towards the woman in an attempt to grab her, but by the time he got there, she already stepped away, and as a swing door going in a circle, she kicked him in the arse, giving him enough momentum to take a real close look at the wall. She looked at the other men in the bar with a gaze that signaled "I'm ready"
- Calm down lady, we're not here to cause trouble. - Says one of the men she looked in the direction of.
- Yeah, he was just drunk. - another man said - He wouldn't go attacking people like that if he was sober.
- Oh. - she said - Alright then.
The men grabbed the unconscious man and started dragging him away, while the woman crouched next to the small man who was still coughing at this point.
- Are you okay Hal? - asked the woman.
- Yeah, I'll be okay. Thank you Ash!
They embraced each other.
One of the men who were dragging away the unconscious man spoke.
- Your name is Ash? You look like a Merida. I would've made a reasonably big bet on your name being Merida.
- Shut up Rick and help us with Ołliver here! - said another man dragging the guy.
The man we now know as Hal took a moment to gather himself, cleared his throat, sat back down to the table and asked:
- So, anyone else wanna play?
Everyone looked at Hal like he was crazy. Everyone but one person, with a black cape and and a ridiculously big, sombrero like, black hat that covered his face as he was looking slightly down. He stood up, slowly walked over to the table, sat down and tilted his head slightly up, looking at Hal revealing his eyes. His left eye was green while other one was blue, and he had a slight mustache.
- Let's play. But only if we both do all-in. - He said.
Hal nodded, his slight grin growing slightly bigger. Ash dealt a hand to both Hal, and the man. The man started talking.
- I always thought about the cards as a battlefield.
As he said this, Hal slightly adjusted his goggles, and his grin turned into a slight frown of frustation as he kept adjusting the goggle.
The man put the cards down upside down, signaling that he will keep these cards. Hal hesitates. He looks at Ash, then he looks at the man before looking at the cards in his hand and finally putting the cards down as well.
The man slowly reveals his cards as he speaks. He reveals the first card. Ace of spades.
- The spades are the swords of the soldiers.
The second card was ace of clubs.
- The clubs are weapons of war.
Ace of diamonds.
- The diamonds are money for funds.
The fourth is the ace of hearts.
- Finally, the heart is the love that may bloom on the battlefield.
He reveals the last card to be the king of hearts, making it a four of a kind.
Hal nervously revealed his cards to be the king of diamonds, clubs and spades, and the queen of diamonds and hearts, making it a full house, which meant Hal lost.
- B-but how didn't you... - Hal mumbled.
- Luck is on my side. - said the man as he was putting the money away - I can tell that you play for the diamonds. I don't respect people like that. However, I can tell that you're also playing for the heart. That's why I'm leaving this to you - he tossed a single coin to Hal - So that you can play again, but this time, go for the heart.
He turned around and left the bar accompanied by the loud clinking of the coins he took. Hal and Ash looked at each other. Outside the bar, the man got on his horse and started cantering, before stopping just a few meters away.
- I feel like something is missing. Like something has gone quiet...
In a moment of realization he looked at his waist, noticing the lack of a coin purse. He started hearing the clinking again. He looked to the source of the sound and saw Hal and Ash on the back of a horse, galloping away as fast as they could. He looked at the clouds.
- Some people just can't be changed...

Between the clouds, there is something strange, something shiny. It looks like a whale made of metal.
- Do you guys see that? - Imrè asks lying besides me.
- No, I can't see anything besides some ants - replied Halál, lying face down on the ground.
- Oh yeah - says Imré before turning him around.
- Yeah, now I see it! That cloud looks like a bread!
- What? No, not that. There's something shiny between the clouds - says Imrè pointing towards it.
- Ohhhh, you mean that! No, I can't see anything shiny.
- Are you blind?
- No, I have a perfect vision. Up to like 5 meters.
- THAT MEANS YOU'RE PRACTICALLY BLIND!
As they argue, a loud, distorted, low frequency sound could be heard from the direction of the metal whale. It sounded a bit like two gigantic metal pieces rubbing against each other.
They both went quiet for a second.
- Did that thing make that sound? - asks Imrè.
- I believe so - I reply.
- What is that thing?
- It looks like a whale.
- It sounds like one as well - inserts Halál.
As we discuss it, the metal whale gets close enough where we can make out the details on it. It's made out of plates, and it has a glowing eye.
- Now I can kinda see it - says Halál.
- It looks like a whale, right? - asks Imrè.
- I don't know, it just looks like a shiny blob...
- Oh my g-
The whale wails so loud, we were almost deafened.
- Did you guys hear that? - asks Halál.
- What did you say? Sorry, I can't hear you over the GIGANTIC METAL WHALE THAT'S RIGHT ABOVE US!
By this time, it was indeed right above us. As it passed, we heard loud metal clickings, and it started to block the sun as it was shining slightly from behind us.
- It's getting night already?
- Can we kill him? Can we just kill him please?
At this point we were practically shouting to hear each other since the clicking of the metal was so loud, but despite that, the whale cried out again deafening us for a few seconds in the process. At this point it was already getting further.
- Let's go after it! - suggests Halál.
- Hell no! - objects Imrè.
- Well, I'm going anyway. You can stay here, that's fine. - says Halál before standing up and immediately going after the metal whale.
- Elły, you don't want to go after that thing, right?
- Well, I certainly am interested in whatever it is, but I'm not gonna leave my family here - I reply.
- Thank you. I really thought you were gonna-
The metal whale cries once more. We look at it, only to see that some things are falling out of it as it idles above our village.
I start sprinting towards the village.

When I get there I see people head-to-toe in plate armor, one of them reading something to the man with the short, blonde hair and the deep scar on his face. Since then I've found out he is the head of Untie. The knight's words echo in his armor.
- By order of King Afonșo you are to leave this village immediately. You will find sanctuary in the capital city, Bupętt. Refusal of this order will result in death.
- This is nonsense! We can't just leave this village! - Replies the head of Untie, while the knight turns around and grabs a rope hanging from the metal whale. - Hey, I'm talking to you!
The knight starts ascending with the rope. When I look up I see above him, Halál climbing the rope.
- What are they thinking?! I'm not gonna leave this village for anyone! - angrily mumbles the head of Untie.
The whale cries out again, and starts swimming through the air once more. Behind me Imrè approaches while panting.
- Phew... You run really fast... - He looks around seeing everyone concerned. - What did I miss?</p><br>

The metal whale as I imagined it:
