      <h1>Chapter 4: Soulfall</h1>
      <p>Today is my first day at school. Schools here are vastly different than they were in the other world. Here, you learn only what's essential for a regular person, including reading, writing, and mathematics. Besides these basic subjects, you can take extra classes depending on what mastery you want. You could learn agricultural knowledge, philosophy, physics and you could get knight training. I chose philosophy and physics. You may wonder what these mean and why I chose them. Well, in philosophy class you learn about history and the state of the world around you, including politics. Physics is the collection of all science known including actual physics, biology, chemistry and advanced mathematics. My goal was to learn more about this world so that's why I chose these two. In my class there are two more girls and twelve boys summing up to 15 students. Seems like it's pretty uncommon for women to go school here. An old man with round glasses, a great beard, and an even greater belly walks in. He introdces himself.
- Hi everyone! I'm gonna be your general knowledge teacher! My name is Mr. Jakøbe! Let's continue with you!
He points at the girl in the furthest seat on the right. She's a very innocent looking, thin, blonde girl with slight curves in her hair.
- H- Hi everyone! My name is Şophia!
The whole class stares at her, as if she was gonna say more about herself, but that was all she said.
- Very well, next one! - says the teacher.
The one next to her was the other girl. Her hair black as coal and as straight as you can get. Her eyes cold as ice and her expression void of any emotion.
- Gründe.
That was all she said. Not very talkative.
- Not very talkative - stole the teacher my exact thoughts - let's continue.
Next in line is a well dressed, handsome boy. You can tell by his eyes that he was full of pride, as if he was on top of the world.
- My name is Gęralt Vindsęnt. I am the heir of the Vindsęnt family who owns the land you live on.
Now I understand what he's so proud of. Being the first born son of a rich family means that all the land his father owns, that the villagers "rent" so they can make their food, will be his when his father dies. For a guy this high in rank, I'm guessing he took philosophy for the extra subject, since politics will play a key role in his life. That means I'll see this twat even in the extra classes. Great.
After this I pay little attention, and gaze the skies through the windows. I can see a kind of fog approaching. Oh! I'm next in line. I'm sitting on the right of the middle row, in front of Şophia, the blonde girl who introduced herself first.
- My name-
Another teacher opens the door.
- Jakøbe, soulfall is approaching!
- Thank you Dęn! Kids, I'm sorry but we'll have to cut this class short. We'll continue with the introductions next class. You should go home now.
We get up and start heading home while chattering about what just happened. I tried getting information from my parents about the strange things I discovered, but they always said that I'm not old enough to get it, and that teachers will explain it in school. I'm assuming that it was similar with the other kids too, so we're all confused. On my way home, I can see a man heading directly towards the fog. Usually people run away when someone says soulfall is coming, so it's weird that he does the exact opposite. Maybe he's one of the men who can create that protective layer around them. I stop for a second thinking if maybe I should follow the man to get answers, or seek shelter like I was told. My curiosity overcomes my fear, and I decide to follow the man. If he sees me, he would just send me home so I have to be sneaky, like a Snake and to overcome my fear, my mind has to be set Solid on my goal. I follow the man as he gets close to the fog and by the time we get close, it already starts to rain. I'm under a roof, so I should be fine. As I look to the man, I realise that I was right. He cteates a protective layer around himself so the rain can't get to him. I follow him further while being careful to always stay under a roof because if even he doesn't want to touch the rain, I definitely don't want to either. We then reach the fog. It's very dense and I can't see anything beyond it but the man, who somehow stays as clear as if there wasn't any fog near him. The fog slowly gets closer and closer to me. I don't know if I should run away from it. I decide that whatever the fog might do, I'm gonna stay right here, even if it turns my insides out. I close my eyes and embrace the fog as it gets close and when it touches me, everything goes silent. I open my eyes but don't see anything. I try to feel my hands, but I can't feel anything. I know something- no, someone is getting closer and closer to me, but I don't know who it is. I can't see them. I know they want me to join them. They get closer and closer to me, I know it. I don't want to join them! I still have a duty to do, I want to live a happy life of my own! I know that I have pushed them away and I open my eyes once again, but this time I can see my hands, I can hear the rain again and I can feel my body. The fog is still here, I can't see anything but gray with the exception of my body. I look around and I see the man through the fog. He is coming towards me.
- Who are you? Are you backup? I don't nee-
As he sees that I'm a child he stops for a second.
- You're just a child and you're just like me? More importantly, why the hell are you here?! You need to get back to your home now!
I see a black figure emerge from the fog behind him.
- Look out! - I shout at him.
He grabs me and starts running.
- Who are you? What's happening? - I ask him. He doesn't respond.
After a while he puts me down.
- Now head back home, I have work to do here!
Now considering that I'm a child and that I would just make his work harder, I agree and start heading home. On my way I realise that I'm out with only the sky above me. The rain hasn't stopped though. Does that mean that I also have this protection around me? I soon got back home. My parents were scared to death that I didn't come home when the soulfall started. They didn't believe my story. They said that I might have got so scared that I thought that it was reality when really it was just my imagination. I somehow doubt that's how being scared works, but I know just the guy to prove them wrong. As soulfall passed I went back to where the man was. I look around but I can't find him until I see a black coat in the grass. That's what he was wearing. Was he knocked unconscious, did he die or maybe he just lost his jacket? I run over there to see that it is indeed the man. But something was different about him. When I looked into his eyes it felt like it was just a hollow husk. I put my hand over his heart only to feel that it's still beating. Maybe he can still be saved? He doesn't bleed, he doesn't have scratches, his body is perfectly intact, but I felt like he was missing something. Not long after, a group of men arrive and as they notice me they come over to me to see the man's corpse.
- Why are you here? - A man checking the corpse asks me - Go back to your parents!
- But I- he-
- Please, just leave me alone for a bit, will you?
I can tell that the death of the man shook him. Was he a relative, or were they just friends? I may never get an answer to this question. I step back contemplating the scene. What a first day at school.</p>
