      <h1>Chapter 5: Death</h1>
      <p>What comes after death? I feel like I knew the answer to that a long time ago but I have forgotten since. People believe that there is a god, someone who has powers over the whole world. A single entity who jumbles around everything at once. Happiness and sadness, love and hatred, creation and destruction; life and death. Is this really how it is? How could one thing play an infinite number of games of Jenga with everything simultaneously. Even if such a powerful entity existed it couldn't have done everything itself. It must've made other entities to help it with these tasks. If you had to do many things at once it would be logical to hire others, right?
- Elłyza, you'll be late for school! Pack your stuff!
Enough cloud gazing for now. Time to actually find stuff out. I pack my stuff, kiss mom goodbye, and head off to school.
The class starts and Mr. Jakøbe walks in. He doesn't bother to let anyone else introduce themselves from the class, including me. He went straight to teaching. Well, it's not like I payed any attention to introductions anyways.
We aren't learning anything too interesting, just basic stuff like how to read, write, and how many apples you'd have if your friend gave you one, but I do pay attention. All of these feel familiar, but I don't actually know them, aside from the very basic mathematics that even a toddler would figure out. However, I do learn fast.
My intense learning session was interrupted by the boy sitting next to me.
- Pretty interesting stuff, huh? I can feel the knowledge just passing right through me and leaving immediately after... Yeah, I don't get any of this... I was thinking... maybe you could help me learn this stuff after the classes are over. You seem like you understand it.
- Uhh... Sure, I can do that; I don't have any plans for this afternoon anyway.
- Yessss, thank you! Let's meet at the community centre after the classes then! Sounds good?
- Sure, why not.
- Alright, see you there! Bye!
And just like that, he slid a few centimeters farther. I'm not sure why he'd say bye since he's still sitting here. Anyways, after this I continue to listen to the teacher until the class ends. The remaining classes go by so fast that for a second, I don't even realize that the last class just ended.
Before he leaves, Mr. Jakøbe reminds us that whoever took Physics as an extra class, should stay. I look at the boy sitting next to me, and before I could say anything he nods. He either knew, or figured out from my reaction that I'm taking that class. Thank god I don't have to worry about that. It would've been unnecessary tension; nobody likes that.
Most of the class leaves and only 4 children remain, including me, Şophia the blonde, shy girl that sits behind me, a boy whose name I don't know, though the fear keeps him moving, still his heart beats so slow, and- who would've thought, that arrogant twat, Gęralt. A tall, blonde, short haired man in a black tailcoat walks in, and introduces himself.
- My name is Mr. Dęnielłe, but you can call me Dęn. - while he speaks, he grabs a seat, turns its back towards us, and sits down on it backwards so he can rest his hands on the backrest. - I'll be your physics teacher. I'd like you to treat me more like how you would treat a friend than a teacher. It'll be easier to keep you guys interested that way. Any questions?
Everyone remains silent.
- All right, let's get started then! - he says as he gets up from the chair and walks to the blackboard - Before we can get into any of the crazy stuff, we gotta understand how we, people work. Everyone has a body and a soul. Without either of these, we aren't people. A body without a soul is just a corpse and soul without a body is just a spirit. Now, what is a soul? A soul is our general knowledge, not to be confused with memories, our goals, our aspirations, our personalities and what is often forgotten, our emotions. It really is what makes us human. However, a soul can not interact with the world around it by itself. It needs a body. But bodies aren't mere puppets controlled by souls. Technically, a body can live on by itself. It 's basic functions work without a soul. It breathes, it' s heart beats, it's stomach continues to process food, it's brain still holds all the memories, it can do pretty much everything except for thinking or making decisions. You could compare it to someone who's sleep-walking. If a soul were to enter an empty body, it would "come to life". This new person would have all the memories of the body, but you would notice that they act differently. They would probably stop loving the ones they were madly in love with, their personality would change completely and they would probably be unhappy in this new body. It has been proven that fetuses have souls, and it is believed that the soul plays a key role in developing the body. That is to say, the souls forms the body to its needs. Scientists believe that it does that by "hand selecting" the genes it wants to inherit. That would mean that if the soul wants curly hair for example, it will choose the genes of the parent who has curly hair. Now, if none of the parents have naturally curly hair the soul is out of luck and that could potentially be a cause of some people not liking some parts of themselves. Of course a lot of this is speculation on our part, since we can't exactly communicate with a soul in the way you'd expect. Some people have the ability to control their souls to an extent, but souls can't really ask questions, and even if they could, a soul couldn't remember the answers, since it has no memory. Does that make sense? - he asks as he looks at us.
Most of us just stare at him in confusion.
- I see... Well, that can be a lot to take in I guess. Your homework is to go home and think this through a little bit. Maybe you'll have a better understanding of it by the time we meet again. I don't want to overload your little brains, so I'll let you guys go now. Class is over, thanks for being here!
With that, he leaves the classroom putting the chair back to its place while doing so. We pack our stuff and leave school for the day. I head straight to the community centre to see if Imrè is there already. The class was short, so I'm not expecting him to be there yet, so I could go home and put my bag down, and come back after. When I get there I see that he's already there. Was he expecting the class to be shorter? How long has he been waiting for me? I'm opening my mouth to apologize for making him wait for me, but before I could say a word he starts speaking.
- Oh, it's already over? I was expecting it to take like a whole hour.
- You were planning on waiting here a whole hour? You're crazy, you could've gone home and come back later!
- Well, if I did, I would've missed you, and then you'd have to be the one who waits.
- I was planning on going home and putting my stuff down if you weren't here, I would've came back after like half an hour.
- Well, we're here now. Let's go to the park and sit down.
When we get to the park, I start explaining the subject to him.
- So what sound does this make then? - I ask him.
- Uhh... "mi"?
- No, this is "la". Are you paying attention at all?
- I'm sorry, I can't concentrate, the village is distracting my thoughts.
- What? How?
- But I know a good place where I'm sure I could concentrate!
- Uh, okay.
- Come on! - He stands up and starts heading to the woods on a small road.
This seems a bit alarming, but I'm not worried about myself. If it comes to that, I'm sure I could protect myself or at least run away. We follow the road for a while, then he suddenly stops.
- This is it!
I look around, but see nothing except trees.
- Where? I don't see anything special.
- Look up!
I look up and see a small tree house on top of the tree we stopped next to.
He starts climbing the tree then looks down on me.
- Come on! Trust me, you're gonna love it!
I climb after him. When we get to the tree house, he lifts a floorboard and moves it to the side before climbing up. When he gets up, he reaches down to me. I grab his hand and he pulls me up. When I get up I look out through a kind of balcony on the side of the house and see a beautiful scenery. I see giant mountains covered in trees just far enough where they start to fade to the blue color of the sky.
- It's quite the view, isn't it? - imrè asks me while he's putting the floorboard back to it's place - Now that we're here I'm sure I could focus better on learning!
I spend a few more seconds on admiring the view before starting the explanation of the subject again. As I'm explaining, Imrè comes ever so slightly closer to me every second before resting his hand on mine. I start to stutter and my voice is starting to tremble as his face gets closer and closer to mine before...
Before we start to hear the sounds of rain hitting the roof of the tree house. We both look out the through the balcony only to find that the sight of the blue mountains is obscured by a dense, grey fog as the sounds of the rain get louder and louder.
- Soulfall...
- Don't worry, as long as we stay in the tree house, the rain can't get to us. - Imrè tries to reassure me, but just as he finishes, we hear a loud thomp. We look out through a window opposite to the balcony only to see a huge tentacle attached to what seemed like a ball of faces emerge from the fog. We close our eyes and embrace each other tighter and tighter as the thomps get louder until... It stops. As the thumping stops we hear the rain get calmer. We open our eyes and quickly back off from each other. The fog starts to disperse, but we hear a squeak. Then a crack. Then tree house starts falling towards the ground. As we land, I open my eyes only to see a man with short black hair a mustache and a very fancy dark red tailcoat.</p>
