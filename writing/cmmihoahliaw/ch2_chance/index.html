      <h1>Chapter 2: Chance</h1>
      <p>I see myself- no, rather I just know I'm there. I don't actually see, hear or feel anything. It's not even like floating, it's just nothing. I feel like I'm nowhere but also everywhere. I know my body is there on the ground, splattered all around. I know exactly how it looks, even though I don't actually see it. It's disgusting. I know an ambulance and the police is arriving. A policeman takes photos of my body and my belongings. Shortly after, two men from the ambulance pull out a black bag with a zipper on it, and they put my mangled body in it. I'm surprised that my body stayed together rather than exploding, but I guess that's only a thing in movies. My body is then transported to a morgue in the city, and the policeman who confirmed who I was by my ID card calls my family. My mother answers the phone and as the policeman speaks, her face turns to pure terror. She cannot say a single word. The policeman tries to talk to her but she doesn't answer. Finally the policeman hangs up and my mom puts the phone down and collapses. She starts crying as if she was tortured. My dad quickly runs in the room questioning my mom what's wrong, but she cannot answer. Feelings of guilt and sadness fill my mind. I followed what happened after for a week. Friends tried to cheer them up to no avail. My family was broken. They couldn't feel happiness after that. This is worse than any hell I could've ever imagined.
Suddenly I feel the presence of a powerful being. I cannot see it, I cannot hear it, I cannot perceive it. I just know it's there. Is this god? It communicates with me, not through words but through something that surpasses language. It's like I cannot understand what it's saying, but I know it perfectly well. It invokes thoughts in my own mind. I have made a grave mistake taking my own life that only caused pain and suffering. However I have been given a chance to make up for it. Not everyone gets this chance so I have to value it. I can choose to reincarnate in a different world which is in grave danger and will be destroyed if nothing is done. I have to make a change that would save millions of lives. This is the only way I can undo my sin. This choice is pretty much already made. It's out of the question if I accept it or not. The being knows I already made the choice. If there's a way to correct for what I've done, I'll do it.
The being's presence fades away as I start to gain my senses back. I still can't see, but I can hear and feel now. I lose knowledge of the world I once lived in and only the strongest of memories remain. I can hear the voice of a woman but it's muffled and I don't understand what she says. I can also hear the voice of a man that is muffled and I don't understand. The woman speaks again. Are they talking? It sounds like they are, but I don't understand a word they say. After they're done talking I feel that I start to move. I move for quite a while, and sometimes I hear the voice of the woman. Shortly after the moving stopped, I hear the woman sing a tune. I've never heard it before, but it's very soothing. A lot of time passes like this and I hear the woman's voice a lot. She seems to always be with me. After all this time, I recognize some words she says but still, I don't know their meanings. And then suddenly, I can hear the woman scream in agony. What happened? Did somebody hurt her? I think I've grown to love this mysterious woman, why are they taking her away from me? These are the thoughts that race through my mind. What feels like seconds after that, I hear multiple people. The woman is still in pain. They're surely here to help her. She's gonna be okay! Then I feel a force pushing me. It pushes me further and further through a hole. I feel the cold air on my head. I'm being pushed out of somewhere? Before I realize, the cold air is cooling my whole body and suddenly I feel a strong urge to breathe. And so I breathe. My lungs hurt. I start to cry. As I open my eyes I quickly realize what has been happening. I was just given birth to.</p>
