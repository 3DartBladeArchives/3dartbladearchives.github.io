      <h1>Chapter 1: Sin</h1>
      <p>You could say I was different than the other children. I never wanted to play sports, or wrestle with the other boys. I cared about my clothes, unlike other boys who just wore the first thing they found. I showed little interest in cars, guns, sports and anything alike. There wasn't a lot I could talk about with boys, so I tried my luck with talking to girls, but of course no girl would talk to me and when I grew older they thought I was in love with them when all I wanted was some company. I finished school as a car mechanic because that's what my parents wanted, but I hated it and I wasn't even good at it so I didn't get a job with it. My life is miserable and I don't know why. I've spent the last few months thinking about a solution that would get me the happiness I've been dreaming about, but it seems I was doomed from birth. The lack of motivation caused by my depression made it virtually impossible to start doing any kind of work or go back to studying. I'm a failure and a burden to my parents. Every night, at around 10pm I go to the roof of the flat we live in to look at the lights of the city while smoking a cigarette. It's so beautiful, I can't get enough of it. But tonight while I was standing here, I realized that I could remove that burden from my parents, that I could end the misery. I can feel my heart in my throat as I stand on the edge of the roof, hoping someone gives me a little push, so I don't have to do it myself. But there's no escaping it. Nobody's here to help me, I'm on my own. As I think about that, I can feel the pain in my heart that is loneliness, and the unpleasant feeling of holding back the cries in my throat. That pushed me over the edge; literally. I'm flying now. For one last time I open my eyes to see the beautiful lights of the city that I love so much. As I'm getting near the ground I close my eyes so the last thing I saw was darkness.</p>
