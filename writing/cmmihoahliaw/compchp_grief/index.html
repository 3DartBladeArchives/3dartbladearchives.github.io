      <h1>Complementary Chapter: Grief</h1>
      <p>The next day they held a funeral for the man that died in the soulfall. Not many people showed up, but one of the people who did was the man that asked me to leave when we found the corpse. He had short, blonde hair, he wore a black leather jacket that was the same as on the man who died, and he had a deep scar along his face. He's sitting on the bench in the church starting down at the foot of the bench in front of him while the priest gave a eulogy. When the priest finishes, he walks up to the podium and gives his speech.
- 5 years ago Bęrnabäs came to me with grief. He wanted to avenge his family who were taken from him on the night of the soulfire. I told him that he was crazy and throwing away his life was not going to help anyone, but he wouldn't give up. He tried again the next day; and again, and again and again. That crazy son of a bitch did this for 2 weeks straight, before I gave in and finally agreed to train him. He would train all day and all night every day. I never actually saw him sleep; I was- and still am surprised he didn't die of sleep depravation. His will was strong. He didn't fear death or loss and he didn't care about anything but his revenge. He repelled soulfall like it was nothing and slain every soulknot that got near him. He was nothing short of a monster himself. That went on for 1 year before he calmed down a little. Before that, you couldn't even talk to him, but slowly he became more and more open to conversations. He was still probably the most serious among us, and he had little to no sense of humor but at least you could have a half-decent conversation with him. His grief was over but he still had a strong motivation, a goal to kill every soulknot that came near this village and protect the people that live here. During those 5 years I trained with him, I had deep conversations with him, I've grown to care for him as a father cares for his kid and now he's been taken away from me-... I never had any kids of my own, but I treated Bęrnabäs like he was my own son. Now I know what it feels like to lose a child. I understand your pain Bęrni. Now I know what fuelled you; but it doesn't fuel me, Bęrni, it really doesn't. I'm sorry... I'm sorry I wasn't there to protect you...
He collapses on the podium, crying as he says the last few words. I've seen enough. It's time for me to go home. I step away from the window I was watching the whole scene unfold through and I head home.</p>
