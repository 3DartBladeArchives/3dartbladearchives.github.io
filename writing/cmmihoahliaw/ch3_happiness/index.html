      <h1>Chapter 3: Happiness</h1>
      <p>So I was reborn in another world. Since then, a few years have passed, so I'll sum up what happened. At first I didn't understand a word people said. They speak a different language here. I don't know why I expected a different world to have the same language. Even in our world there were different languages between the countries, so it's only natural that it's the same here. Anyways, since then I learned a lot of words and now I understand most things people say. However I am having difficulties with saying the words myself my grammar and pronunciations are bad, but mother somehow always knows what I want to say. For a long time I couldn't move my body the way I wanted to, it just moved in weird directions, so I had to relearn to move too. I have became much better since. I can now traverse the world on my own. I can go wherever I want to. At least as long as mother or father doesn't get me that is. At just 3 years old I have the ability to explore the whole world with my ability to crawl but these two keep stopping me. But I still love them very much. They're loving, caring parents. Mother always dresses me up in all kinds of clothes, and to be honest I like it! They look nice. Father always brings gifts home from his work, including sweets, dolls and other toys. And the other kids. To me, it seems like they always want to play with me more than the other kids, but I like the attention. I've seen many new things in this world too that I've never seen before. Once every year, some blue flowers seem to appear out of nowhere, staying only for some time before they die. I tried getting my hands on one to research it, but my parents stopped me. That leaves me to believe that it might be dangerous. I have also conducted thorough research with most household objects I found in the house, and the gifts I got from father, but my teeth growing out had set back my ability to do so a great deal, since some research samples get destroyed in the process now. Very unfortunate. Getting back to the new things I found, we have a gateway to another, identical world in our living room. I tried entering it several times, but another kid on the other side stops me by mimicking my movements. I have also tried conducting research on both the gate, and the kid on the other side, but sadly, my hard work did not pay off in understanding the inner workings of the gate, or the purpose of the child's mimicking. Very, very unfortunate. Another new thing I've seen is that sometimes some kind of liquid falls from the sky causing havoc all over the place, encouraging my parents to seek shelter as soon as possible. Some people can create a protective layer around themselves during this time, but I have never seen what their motive for staying outside is, since I always got back to a safe place, making it hard for me to understand these people. Incredibly unfortunate. These are the three new things I have found over the three years I've spent in this world. Further research is needed for all of them. I feel like they might be connected. Soon I'll be able to have deep conversations with mother about all these things and so my question will surely be answered, since she knows every single thing about this world in detail, as a mother should. I have already tried asking the only question I can pronounce over and over again in hopes of understanding the world more thoroughly, but mother seemed incredibly annoyed after the fifth time I asked "why?". That is all I have to say for now- Oh, that's right! Did I mention that I was born here as a girl?</p>
