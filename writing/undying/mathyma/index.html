      <h1>Mathyma Green</h1>
      <p>During the war, Mathyma was defeated on the battlefield. He was lying on the battlefield unconscious, thought to be dead by everyone. He woke up after the fight. Wounded, he went to a nearby village. There the doctor helped him, and the people fed him. When they asked who he was, he lied and told the people he was someone else from his unit. He said that he didn't have anyone, and that he'd be happy to help these people on their farms. He got news about his own death, and the treaty between the two nations. He was content. Everyone around him started grieving over the fact that they didn't have anything to fight for, but he told them every time that they don't need to have a grand goal, just enjoy life, but to no avail. The plague came, and turned all the people in the village mad, except Mathyma. He accepted to live without a goal. He fled from the village and started living on his own in an abandoned farmhouse not too far.

When you meet him, he doesn't tell you who he is. He just lives in the abandoned farmhouse. After some time, he will have the house fully repaired.</p>
