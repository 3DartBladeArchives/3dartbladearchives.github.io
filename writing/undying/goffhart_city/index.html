      <h1>Golden city Goffhart</h1>
      <p>Long ago, the city of Goffhart was no more than the Gorot nation's capital, Gorhart, but when Galdur Goffhart became king, he started growing the city, eventually turning it into a nation sized city.

Before the plague started, Goffhart was the greatest, most advanced nation-city on the planet. When the plague broke out, by order of king Galdur, engineers built Yllyza that could house nearly all of Goffhart. However, there were still people who were left behind, now wandering the streets of the city.</p>
