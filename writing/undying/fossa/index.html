      <h1>Aloof Fossa</h1>
      <p>The kingdom of Fossa is located in the mountains of the North.
Fossa once had a thriving community, with a huge community centre where a huge fire, fed by the rare, flammable, long burning iron supplied by the the King of Manferro. This fire burned with such intensity that it warmed up not only the community centre, but with the help of a water based heating system, every house in the capitol of Fossa. It even kept the streets from beaing deadly cold. Big events were held in the community centre and parades on the streets were common. However, when the crowns of Manferro were stolen, the King of Manferro stopped supplying the rare iron, basically freezing Fossa. The community events stopped because of the cold. There were no more parades. People were advised to stay at home and keep themselves warm by burning anything they had. The cold was not the problem however. These houses were built in a way to keep the warmth inside as much as possible, so people weren't freezing to death. The problem was that people didn't leave their houses and rather stayed inside, since the streets were now cold enough to kill. In addition to that, people wanted to open their doors as rarely as possible, since the warm would escape and the resources of heat were limited. This resulted in a loss of community in Fossa, and people being isolated. People weren't able to accept this and became depressed. When the maddening plague came, this is what the reason was for them turning mad.

If you get here early, the buildings still have some warmth inside them, meaning you can go inside a building to stop hypothermia.
If you get here later, the buildings already cooled down since the maddened didn't keep them warm, and you can't go inside them to warm up, making the whole area harder.

Othinn's house is always warm.</p>
