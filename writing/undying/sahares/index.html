      <h1>Parched Sahares</h1>
      <p>Sahares is one of the oldest nations, and they have had Elvergryn colonised for a long time. However, when Galdur Goffhart became King of Goffhart, then known as the nation of Gorot, he minimised all trades to have the resources to grow the city of Goffhart, then known as Gorhart, into the nation-city it is today. That meant Sahares had to rely on Elvergryn to provide them with food, which led to Elvergryn's protest, and eventually, it becoming independent in the Green war. This left the once great Sahares completely powerless. The king and the people couldn't accept this loss of power, leading to their madness.</p>
