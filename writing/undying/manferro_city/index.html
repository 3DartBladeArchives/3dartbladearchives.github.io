      <h1>Scorched Manferro</h1>
      <p>The volcanic lands of Manferro were once ruled by King Varkruss Marron. During the Green War, King and Queen Marron's crowns were stolen. King Marron blamed Sahares and wanted revenge, while the Queen tried calming him down, telling him that it's not worth getting revenge over it. King Marron announced this and put a bounty on the crowns and the thief's head, leading to the whole nation wanting the crowns, and revenge. When the plague started, everyone turned mad but the queen who was able to accept the loss of the crowns.</p>
