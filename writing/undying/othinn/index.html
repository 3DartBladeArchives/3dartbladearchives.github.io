      <h1>Othinn Emana</h1>
      <p>Othinn Emana is the all knowing historian of Fossa. He always lived in solitude alongside his books in order to learn as much about the world as possible. As a result, he accepted the loss of community long before the maddening plague started, so he stayed sane.

You can show any item to Othinn and he will tell you everything he knows about it, giving you a description of that item.</p>
