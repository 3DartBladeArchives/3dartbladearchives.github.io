      <h1>Mahhad Vaparry</h1>
      <p>Mahhad Vaparry was one of the greatest merchants in Sahares before the Green war. However, after the war, he had to sell his caravan and fire his men to be able to afford food. However, that didn't discourage him, and he quickly accepted his loss of power, enjoying the challenge of travelling and trading on his own. Now, after the maddening plague, he decided to see the world, and now he travels through all the nations.

First, he can be found in Sahares. After that he moves to Fossa. Then he's in Goffhart. Then he moves to Harslov. Next he's in Manferro. Finally, he arrives in Elvergryn where he meets Mathyma and joins him in farming, with the help of all the goods he's gathered.

While travelling he gathers information on all the tools, weapons, armour etc. If you meet him at one of these locations, he will ask you to bring him some materials. If you do, he will sell you more goods related to that area, and leave to the next area sooner.</p>
