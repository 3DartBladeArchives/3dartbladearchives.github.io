      <h1>Yllyza, the aerial sanctuary</h1>
      <p>When the plague broke out, the greatest minds of Goffhart united to create "Yllyza, the aerial sanctuary", a blimp city big enough to house nearly all of Goffhart, named after the king's dead wife. They've built in in a rush, but it worked perfectly. Once it was built everyone wanted to get on board. Politicians and other people deemed important were the first to get onto Yllyza, including the king of Goffhart, Galdur Goffhart. Little did they know, the son of king Galdur, Yllorian, was already infected with the plague, but he is one of the undying so he didn't show any symptoms.

By now, the entirety of Yllyza has gone mad including the king, but excluding the price who has tried talking to his father countless times, always ending in his father killing him. Now he's just sitting by the entrance of the royal residence, blaming himself, wondering why he got left unmaddened.

The reason why everyone went mad is because they all shared the grief of the king, who never talked to Yllorian about his mother, leaving him the only person in the kingdom who never heard a word about his mother.</p>
