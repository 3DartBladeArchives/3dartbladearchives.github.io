      <h1>Flourishing Elvergryn</h1>
      <p>Before the plague, Elvergryn was a colony of Sahares fighting for its independence. The main figure of this fight was a man named Mathyma Green. He represented the people, and made their voices heard. He attempted to make a treaty with the Sahares king many times, but to no avail. Mathyma decided that a more radical approach was needed. He encouraged people to go on strikes, stop giving food to the Saharians until they accept a treaty. This was a real threat to the Saharians because they couldn't grow enough food in their deserts for everyone, that's why they colonised Elvergryn. This strike went on for a while before the Sahares king decided that they will take what they want with force. This meant war. Obviously Elvergryn didn't have an army to defend themselves, so Mathyma called for help. He convinced the king of Manferro to send support in exchange for a treqty, which promised low prices for food for decades. With the help of Manferro, they managed to fend off the forces of Sahares. The Saharians were starving, and a long war would not help them, so they agreed to sign a treaty with the leader of Elvergryn that gave independence to Elvergryn in exchange for the possibility of trading. With that, Elvergryn became the centre of food for the neighbouring nations. However, Mathyma fought during the war, and he went missing on the battlefield.

With their goal achieved, the people of Elvergryn lost their purpose. They achieved everything they wanted, but now they didn't have anything to fight towards. And that is when the plague broke out, and turned people mad.</p>
