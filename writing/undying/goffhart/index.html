      <h1>Royal Family, Goffhart</h1>
      <p>The head of the royal family, Galdur, the king of Goffhart, met Yllyza, the love of his life who would later give birth to prince Yllorian. Galdur, assisted by Yllyza, was the one who made Goffhart into the grand city of gold it is today, and Yllyza named it after his family.

However, Yllyza died when giving birth to Yllorian, leaving Galdur unable to accept her death, and forever in grief. While he does find happiness in raising his son, the statues of his once wife that the people made in memory of her kept reminding him of his grief.

When the plague started, he ordered the construction of "Yllyza, the aerial sanctuary" named after his lost wife, once again creating something that would only remind him of his grief. This turned out to be a mistake, since Yllorian was infected with the plague, and being unable to accept his wife's death, he became mad when the plague reached him. Now Yllorian is trying his best to talk to him, but when he finds out it's no use, he breaks down and sits at the entrance of the royal residence.

If you get to this boss early, Yllorian will try to stop you from killing the king and will be hostile towards you. If you still manage to get past the undying Yllorian and kill the king, unable to accept his father's death, Yllorian will go mad and pursue you.
If he kills you, he will leave Yllyza and enter the Abyss where he becomes abnormal, and he will become a boss.
If you kill him... Well, he will be dead.

If you get to this boss later, Yllorian will be sitting by the entrance broken down.
If you talk to him and tell him the right things, he will accept the loss of his father early, and you can call for his help with the boss.
If you don't tell him the right things, he will not help you, but after you defeat Galdur, he will accept his death, staying undying and helping you out.</p>
